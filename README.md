# Decoders for Milesight IoT LoRaWAN Sensors

Example decoder functions to Milesight-IoT end-devices. Updated by MCCI to decode
more of the system messages, and to be more robust in case of unexpected data
from the devices.

MCCI also added the Node-RED functions, to assist with decoding the data after receiving the messages from TTN V3 via MQTT.
